    # however I kind of need them during typechecking. Short of vendoring
    # everything, which I strongly don't want to do, my only option is to abuse
    # fixed-output derivations to grab them during the build. This heavily goes
    # against the spirit of nix, but since the real build is pure and this build
    # is purely to simplify CI checks, I'm fine with it for now. To make sure
    # the checks actually happen and aren't just skipped by nix caching, the
    # output hash needs to bind to the inputs. The easiest way I could come up
    # with was hashing the NAR of src in a separate derivation, setting the
    # output hash of this to the hash of that string, and then writing the hash
    # string after checks pass so final hash matches our prior hash of a hash.
